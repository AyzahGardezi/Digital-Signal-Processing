**Lab objectives:**
- Introduce students to the theoretical background of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), including its mathematical formulation and its significance in signal processing. 
- Guide students through the implementation of the DFT algorithm in MATLAB. 
- Visualize the input signal, its DFT spectrum, and the reconstructed signal from the inverse DFT.
