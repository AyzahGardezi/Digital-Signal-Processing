**Learning Outcomes:**
By the end of the lab, students should be able to: 
- Define quantization in the context of discrete-time discrete-valued signals. 
- Explain the process of quantization and its role in signal processing. 
- Analyze the effects of quantization on the quality and fidelity of signals. 
- Identify the trade-offs involved in choosing the number of quantization levels. 
- Implement quantization in a programming environment. 
- Observe and interpret the results of quantization on different types of signals. 
- Conduct quantization error analysis and understand its impact on signal quality. 

**LAB TASKS:**
**Effects of Quantization with variable precision levels**
- Simulate a sampled composite signal of 𝑓𝑑1=125 samples/sec and 𝑓𝑑2=150 samples/sec with length of the signal be 250 samples.  
- Take the desired number of significant digits from the user as input.  
- Then choose the method of Quantization (round-off, floor & ceiling) and apply to the signal generated above.  
- Compute the quantization error signals and explore the impact of each method. 

**Audio signal quantization to various bits per sample**
- You need to record a 5-second audio clip and quantize it with only 1 significant digit. 
- After plotting the original audio signal, the rounded audio signal, and the error signal, notice the results.  
- Change bit depth to 2,3,4 and then listen and take notes of your observations.  
- Decide no. of bits for audio until quality stops improving. 
- Use audiorecorder function for recording the voice and soundsc function for playing the recorded audio.
