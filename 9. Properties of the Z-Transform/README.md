**Lab objectives:**
- Gain a clear understanding of fundamental properties such as linearity, time shifting, convolution, and scaling properties of the Z-transform. 
- Learn how to perform Z-transform operations in MATLAB to analyze discrete-time signals and systems. 
- Apply theoretical concepts of the Z-transform to practical scenarios by verifying properties using MATLAB simulations. 
- Enhance programming skills in MATLAB by implementing algorithms to compute Z transforms and verify properties.

**Lab Tasks:**

Task 1: 
- Generate a discrete-time signal 𝑥[𝑛] with known values. 
- Shift the signal in time by a certain number of samples (positive or negative). 
- Compute the Z-transforms of the original signal 𝑥[𝑛] and the shifted signal. 
- Verify the time shifting property of the Z-transform by comparing the Z-transforms of the original and shifted signals.

Task 2:  
- Create two discrete-time signals 𝑥[𝑛] and ℎ[𝑛] with known values. 
- Convolve the signals in the time domain to obtain the output signal 𝑦[𝑛]. 
- Compute the Z-transforms of 𝑥[𝑛], ℎ[𝑛], and 𝑦[𝑛]. 
- Verify the convolution property of the Z-transform by confirming that the Z-transform of 𝑦[𝑛] is equal to the product of the Z-transforms of 𝑥[𝑛] and ℎ[𝑛].
