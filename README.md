Task 1. Consider the following CT signal: 
x(t) = sin (2 pi F0 t).  
The sampled version will be x(n) = sin (2 pi F0/Fs n),  
where n is a set of integers and sampling interval Ts=1/Fs.  
Plot the signal x(n) for n = 0 to 99 for Fs = 5 kHz and F1 = 0.5, 2, 3 and 4.5 kHz.  
Explain the similarities and differences among various plots.  

Task 2. Generate a tone in MATLAB with varying frequency: 
f = 1000,2000,3000,4000, 5000, 6000, 8000, 9000, 25000, -1000, -2000, -3000 Hz with Fs = 8000 
samples/sec. Listen to the tones, and observe at Sounds like what frequency? Also Specify whether 
Aliasing is happening or not.  
Use the function ‘sound’ to generate tones of different frequencies. 
Add a small pause between tones.
