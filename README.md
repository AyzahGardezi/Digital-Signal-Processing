**Digital Signal Processing**

This repository includes all the tasks performed in my lab for the course Digital Signal Processing. Currently labs 6 and 7 are missing, I suspect I solved the tasks on a PC in the lab and forgot to copy them. If I find them or happen to have enough motivation to attempt them, I will upload them soon afterward.

Content:
1. The effects of Sampling in Discrete Time Signals
2. The effects of Quantization in Discrete Time Discrete Valued Signals.
3. The Impulse Response, observing convolution.
4. The discrete time correlation and apply it to real data to observe the correlation between two signals.
5. The relationship between z-transform and DTFT.
6. To observe/find different frequency components in an audio signal. [_missing_]
7. Z transform and Inverse z transform. [_missing_]
8. DFT function-straighforward implementation and testing
9. Exploring Properties of the Z-Transform.
